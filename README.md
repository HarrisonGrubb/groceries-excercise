# Groceries Excercise
A script that takes one input to run through two functions, sorting the ouput by product and department.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7
* Anaconda 3.7
* Pip

## Installation
Feel free to fork this repo! You can then download it onto your local machine using either git or the gui interface on Github.com's site.
Navigate to the repo once you've got it downloaded.

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new enviroment, I called my groceries-env
```
conda create -n groceries-env
conda activate groceries-env
```
## Usage 
Run the recommendation script:
```
python groceries.py

```

And the file will output the results

## Potential Changes in Future
It may be updated to read in a file and organize the output, or this may be the final iteration...who knows!
